/**
this folder containts Vigorous Hive components for PHP
@author Yuriy Ohonin http://lcc.vihv.org

Some Rules:

Notation: CamelCase, (Delphi style)
	methods starts with lowercase letter like getValue()
	variables - should be no public variables, all covered with getters and setters

One class - one file (NetBeans like), File name should be the same as class name
No global variables
No functions - all should be inside classes

Namespaces - no namespace but should add it as far as php 3.5 will be commonly used, after what all classes should be inside "vihv" namespace like \vihv\Sample()

@requires
PHP 5.3
